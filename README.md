# Algorithms and Data Structures

So that's what "ads" stands for: Algorithms and Data Structures.  Here we
implement various algorithms and data structures for practice and/or review.

## Programming Language

Of course, here we don't implement the ADS using pseudocode, unlike some
textbooks!  We want to see them in action, so we have to write them in *some*
programming language.  Mostly I have used Go, as it seems to be a fine language
for the purpose.  But it can be some other (possibly interpreted) language if I
find that more convenient or I get curious about how something would work out
in a different language.

## Textbooks

These ADS are fairly standard ones, so you can refer to any good textbook on
the topic if you want to review the material, and there are many.  As for
myself, looks like I will mostly be using CLRS (Introduction to Algorithms) and
ADM (Steve Skienna's Algorithm Design Manual).

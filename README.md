# Algorithms and Data Structures

So that's what "ads" stands for: Algorithms and Data Structures.  Here we
implement various algorithms and data structures for practice and/or review.

## Programming Language

Our implementations don't use pseudocode here, like what they do in some of the
textbooks!  We want to see the algorithms action, so we need to write them in a
*real* programming language.  Mostly I have used Go, as it seems to be a fine
language for the purpose: concise, expressive and efficient.  But occassionally
it can be some other language (possibly an interpreted one like Python) if I
find that more convenient or I get curious about how something would work out
in a different language.

## Textbooks

These ADS are fairly standard ones, so you can refer to any good textbook on
the topic if you want to review the material.  And there are many.  As for
myself, looks like I will mostly be using "Introduction to Algorithms" by CLRS,
and "Algorithm Design Manual" by Steve Skienna.

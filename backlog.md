# Algorithms that can be useful for coding interviews

Implement:

- the binary search algo
- the merge sort algo
- the quick sort algo
- a hash-table class/DS
- a linked list class/DS
- a BST class/DS
- a solution to the knapsack problem (using DP)
- Prim's algorithm for minimal spanning trees (using GA)
- a solution to the N-queens problem (using BT)
- max sum of a subarray of size k using the "sliding window" algo (?)
- intersection of two sorted arrays using the "two-pointers" algo (?)
- DFS in a graph
- BFS in a graph
- the union-find algorithm to detect cycles in graphs (?)

(Happened to see this list in a Google feed.)
